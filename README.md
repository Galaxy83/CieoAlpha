Cieo Version 0.1 Alpha

Cieo library for Android is trying to provide a simple API for text animation.

Currently, Cieo is in Alpha version. This means that it is not recommended to be used on production programs, unless you tested it 100%. It also means that there is at least one known bug. Also, the source code is poorly documented.

Cieo is provided as is, and there isn't much support yet. Use it at your own risk.
